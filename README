parse-helper.js is a javascript library for building controls for assisting
in the entry of parsing codes during linguistic annotation.

The idea is that the controls could be attached to any text input expecting
a parse code to be entered.

It currently includes support for the CCAT parsing codes for Ancient Greek
(as used by the MorphGNT project). Other parsing schemes are planned.

The CCAT support includes filtering available attributes based on
part-of-speech selected (and choice of verbal mood can further refine the
options).

At the moment there is no support for going the other way and taking an
existing parse code as a string and correctly showing the individual attribute 
values selected. This will be coming soon.

This project is at a very early stage and I'm sure the code could be improved
a lot. I'm no Javascript expert.

I'm grateful to Weston Ruter for his assistance in generalizing some of the
Javascript.
